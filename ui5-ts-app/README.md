Here are the source for the `wdi5` workshop at UI5con 2022.

## prep

This is an `npm`-based mono repo. **So at least Node >= 16 with npm >= 7 is needed**.

It consits of three types of apps:

- plain JS-based UI5 app
- TypeScript-based UI5 app, incl UI5 Webcomponents
- Fiori Elements app

```shell
$> npm i
```

...will install all dependencies and modules for all three applications in one Go.
